            These words were spoken by Walt Disney in the opening moments of the dedication of the first, and in my opinion the best, theme park ever built. Over the past 66 years, Disneyland has become one of the most popular theme parks in the world. Second in annual attendance only to it's sister park, Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort, Disneyland hosts almost 20 million guests annually. Though the park has undergone significant changes since opening day, it still maintains all of the wonder and delight that Walt and his team infused it with when first designing and building this timeless attraction. Here I'll share some information about my favorite "Happiest Place on Earth"!

                    Disneyland opened in Anaheim, California on July 17th, 1955. From the very first day of operation, it was incredibly popular, and it was easy to see why. The first of park of its kind in United states, Disneyland was a unique entertainment experience for both children and adults. Prior to Disneyland, anything that might be refered to as an amusement park was either places that were considered too seedy or dangerous to take children, or were places for the children to have all the fun while the parents sat and watched. It was at once such place, Griffith Park in Los Angeles California, while sitting on a park bench as his daughters rode a merry-go-round, that Walt Disney first envisioned the park that would become Disneyland. He wanted a place where children and parents could have fun together. Construction began on July 16th, 1954. Yes, you read that correctly. Disneyland was built in just one year and one day.

                    Opening day was, to put it bluntly, a disaster. More than half the people who entered the park that day did so with forged tickets. Many just hopped the fence. This caused massive shortages thoughout the park, with most food and beverages sold out before the afternoon. There were no working waterfountains, as Disney had been forced to choose between those and working bathrooms due to a labor dispute. The temperature in Anaheim that day soared to a sweltering 101 degrees. That heat, combined with asphault streets that had been freshly poured only days prior, reportedly resulted in the heels of womens shoes sinking into the pavement as they walked. And as if that were not enough, a gas leak forced the closure of 60% of the park only hours after its opening.

                    Undetered, Walt Disney stepped to the microphone that morning to deliver the dedication speech for Disneyland. I've included video of this speech, which was watched live by over 90 million viewers as part of a special broadcast by the ABC network. Though it was a rough beginning, the magic of the park could not be denied. Over five million people visited the park within that first year, and attendance has grown steadily ever since. The park has undergone many changes in its nearly seven decades of operation. The park originally opened with 5 themed areas. These were Main Street USA, Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland. Disneyland has since been expanded several times to add new "lands" to the originals. New Orleans Square was the first of these additions, opening in 1966. Next was Critter Country (originally named Bear Country) in 1972. Mickey's Toon Town was added in 1993. Finally, Star Wars Galaxy's Edge was opened in 2019. Further, both Fanstasyland and Tomorrowland have undergone extensive updates from their opening day appearences. Attractions originally required tickets, and some attractions cost more than others. Attrations were seperated into 5 categories designated by the letters A-E. If you have ever heard the phrase "E Ticket Ride", it originated from Disneyland. In 1982, the ticket system was dropped and unlimited access to all attractions was included in the cost of admission to the park.

                    Since that hot July day in 1955, over 740 million visitors have entered the gates of Walt's fantastical playground. It has been, and continues to be, a source of wonder, magic, inspiration, and joy for millions worldwide. Walt's dream was to build the "Happiest Place On Earth". With the creation of Disneyland he achieved that and so much more, in mare ways than even his brilliantly creative mind could ever have imagined.

                        <p class="paragraph">Inspired by Walt Disney's hometown of Marceline, Missouri, Main Street, U.S.A. is designed to resemble the center of a turn-of-the-20th-century American town. The first area guests of the park enter after coming in the front gate and passing through a tunnel under the tracks of the Disneyland Railroad, this small slice of Americana transports guests back to a simpler time. Horse-drawn carriages and double decker busses cruise up the length of the road, while the sounds of the train echo from Main Street Station. In the distance, Sleeping Beauty's Castle beckons you further into the park. You may hear a barbershop quartet siging old tunes of yesteryear, or see The Disneyland Band marching down the road. Lastly, above the fire station next to City Hall, you will see a single lamp glowing in the window. This lamp is inside Walt Disney's private apartment inside the park and was turned on to signal that Walt was in the park that day. Diseyland now keeps the lamp lit 24/7 to signify that the spirit of Walt Disney forever lives in the park he created.

A large tiki mask gazes down upon them over the sign declaring the strange new world they are about to enter. One of the five original lands, Adventureland is designed to appear as a marketplace located in a dense tropical jungle, blending African, Caribbean, and Pacific influences. Located right at the entrance from the hub, Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room has been entertaining guests since 1963. This was the first attration to feature Audio-Animatronics, which would become a staple of Disney attractions. The merchants offer supplies for your jungle excursions, as well as unique wares from the local craftsmen. The smell of exotic local foods waft through the air. All through the land, the drum beats and chants of the native jungle tribes can be heard beckoning you deeper into the jungle. Walking away from the shops and restaraunts, brave guests can become intrepid explorers by stepping into the dockhouse of the Jungle Cruise, delve into the mysterious grounds of the Temple of the Forbidden Eye, or climb Tarzan's Treehouse.

Frontierland is a snapshot of America's expansion westward and as guests walk through it they experience the progress from rugged wilderness to more civilized railways, riverboats, and roads. Built to resemble an old west mining town, Frontierland seamlessly blends the rough and tumble world of Davy Crockett with the modern sensibility of Mark Twain. Elk and deer antlers adorn the top of the general store, so that cowboys know immediately where they can aquire supplies. And though there are no horses tied in front of the Golden Horseshoe Cafe, the sounds of the stage performers and cheering crowds let you know the local watering hole is always busy. Along the Rivers of America, guests can board the Mark Twain Riverboat, a 5/8-scale stern-wheeler steamboat that in 1955 was the first of its kind to be build in the US in over 50 years. Also sailing guests around the River is the Columbia, a 3-masted sailing ship deisgned as a replica of the first US ship to circumnavigate the globe, the Columbia Rediviva. At the center of the river sits Tom Sawyer Island. Guests can take a ferry to the island and explore its winding trails and tunnels. Just watch out for pirates!

This iconic structure serves at the main entrance to Fantasyland, one of the five original lands and reportedly Walt's favorite. Within this area, which feels like it was plucked straight out of a fairytale, guests will find numerous rides based on classic disney animated features. Many of these rides have been a part of Disneyland since its very first day of operation. The catsle itself was designed to be seen from almost everywhere in the park, as was intended as a landmark for guests to use so that they could easily find their way back to the central hub no matter where they were. Originally decorated in a renaissance style, in 1983 it was remodeled to resemble a Bravarian villiage, which helps create the fairytale look of the land. It is also home to the second largest feature in the park, Matterhorm Mountain. There guests can ride the Matterhorn Bobsleds, which was the first steel tubular track rollercoaster and revolutionalized rollercoaster construction  worldwide. North of the Matterhorn, you will find the whimsical home of It's a Small World. Originally a part of the 1964 New York World's Fair, the ride was relocated to Disneyland in it's entirety in 1966.

                        <p class="paragraph">Tomorrowland was the last of the five original lands to be completed, and has also seen the most changes out of any of the original lands. Located to the east of the central hub, guests can tell they are headed into a futuristic setting by the look of the large, rotating spire of Astro Orbiter. Passing under an archway, guests find themselves a land that encompasses what Disney Imagineers have envisioned for the future, though that vision has chaged a lot since 1955. Many futuristic attractions can be found in this land, including another iconic Disney attration, Space Mountain. Autopia, an opening day attration, can be found here as well. Guests have been driving its highways and byways for 66 years. Tomorrowland is also home to the Disneyland submarine fleet, part of the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage. Walt Disney once dubbed these the "largest fun time fleet of submarines in the world". Lastly, located directly above the loading docks of the submarines is the boarding platform for the Disneyland Monorail, the first permanent monorail system in the western hemisphere. This futuristic transport shuttles guests between its Tomorrowland station and a station located outside the park in the Downtown Disney District, close to the three Disneyland Resort hotels.

                        <p class="paragraph">Based on the real world US city of New Orleans as it looked in the 19th century, New Orleans Square was the first land to be added to Disneyland after the park opened. More of a series of streets than an actual "square", it was also the last area of the park, and contained the last two attractions, that Walt himself would have a hand in designing. The land opened in July of 1966, less than 6 months before Walt would pass away. Located on the banks of the Rivers of America, New Orleans Square can be reached by passing through Frontierland or Adventureland. Here, guests are surrounded by the sights and sounds of the deep south, with jazz music echoing through the streets of the French Quarter inspired buildings. Since the original city of New Orleans was an important post city on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, it natually made sense that there be an attraction about pirates in the land. Pirates of the Carribean can be found right near the entrance to New Orleans Square. On the other end of the square, past the shops and restaraunts, guests can visit the Haunted Mansion and its "999 happy haunts".

Originally named the Indian Villiage and considered part of Frontierland, the area was rethemed in 1972 to become the seventh themed land in Disneyland. Towering over the entire area is Splash Mountain. This attraction sends guests on an exciting log ride ending in a thrilling drop of 16m (52.5ft) into a small splash pool. Riders are often soaked by the time they exit the ride, which can be a refeshing cooldown during the hot California summers. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh can be found here as well. Formerly the home of the Country Bear Jamboree, it was converted to a Winnie the Pooh themed dark ride in 2003. FInally, if you feel like working out your arms, Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes can be boarded here for a trip arounf the Rivers of America. This is the only attraction powered exclusively by guests. The canoes have no motor, and are powered only by the rowing of its passengers and the two guides that accompany them.

                        <p class="paragraph">Mickey's Toontown is the 8th land opened in the park. Located past It's a Small World attraction, this largely child-focused area opened in Disneyland in 1993. The area is inspired by Who Framed Roger Rabbit and resembles a set from a Max Fleischer cartoon. The buildings are stylized and colorful. There are several attractions involving classic cartoon characters, such as the houses of Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and a small children's coaster. The main draw of this land is as a place where you can meet many of Disney's most well known classic characters, as they all make this area their home. The fictional backstory given for Mickey's Toontown is that it was a hidden Toon suburb that Mickey Mouse had moved to in 1930 to keep in touch with his humble Midwestern roots, with his friends following soon after. When Walt Disney was looking for a location to build Disneyland, Mickey pointed him towards a large orange grove nearby for him to build his park. After the park opened, Mickey and his friends would travel between their Toontown homes and Disneyland to meet the countless guests that visited the park, before eventually deciding to open their hometown to the public later in the 90’s, digging a tunnel through the berm.

It's setting is the villiage of Black Spire Outpost on the remote planet of Batuu. Entering this land, guests are transported to a galaxy far, far away to experience their own adventures in this treasured sci-fi setting. Guests can meet and interact with well know characters from the Star Wars universe. They can pilot infamous Millenium Falcon, recreated in full scale as the centerpiece of the land, on the Smuggler's Run attraction. Feel free to purchase a drink from the cantina, then peruse the shops in the marketplace for goods sourced from every corner of the galaxy. There's even a rumor that you can aquire your own custom built lightsaber, the weapon of the legendary Jedi, if you can find the hidden shop they are made in, though I doubt such rare items come cheap. Finally, the truly adventurous can join the fight against the First Order by riding Rise of the Resistance, the newest and most advanced attraction at Disneyland.
